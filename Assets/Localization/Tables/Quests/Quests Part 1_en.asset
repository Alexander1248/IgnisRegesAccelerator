    m_Localized: My sleep was disturbed by an agitated voice from the walkie-talkie.
      What happened that they call me at night? I told you in human language not
      to switch to my frequency at such and such hours. Well, in any case, I need
      to answer, if it's something urgent.

    m_Localized: Am I really in a dream? The Baron of the Floating Islands himself
      is not far from me in the endless fog, where his flotilla is unlikely to come
      to the rescue. This is the perfect time to storm! It remains only to figure
      out exactly where it is, thanks to the electronics that I found on the ruins
      of the followers of the Gitz.

      remains only to figure out how to go further. Should I try to use this cannon
      on this target?
